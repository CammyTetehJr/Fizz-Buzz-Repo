# Fizz-Buzz-Repo
A program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), prints "Buzz" instead. It Prints "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those). and returns the numbers not divisible by 3 and 5.
